# Periodic Sentence Bot

A discord bot that will check your messages to see if they can be spelled using elements of the periodic table.

Inspired by [this reddit bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/PeriodicSentenceBot/).

If you don't want to bother setting up your own instance, you can [invite the bot here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1245674334979362817&permissions=274877910016&scope=bot+applications.commands)
